# amamzon-reviews-classifier
This program uses a pretrained text embedding model () to classify amazon food reviews as being either negative, positive, or neutral. It was built using a variety of python libraries, namely the tensorflow machine learning library, and was deployed using docker.

Through this guided project, I learnt about machine learning model life cycles, from building to training, depolyment, and version updating. The projects main tasks are summarized below:

- Loading and processing of Amamzon review data
- Building and training text classification model with Keras and TensorFlow Hub
- Exporting modle as Protobuf and testing model
- Deploying via Tensorflow Serving with Docker
- Set up REST client and gRPC client to preform predictions
- Versioning the TensorFlow
